## Remember
- Replace the local extension folder name with the `"uuid"` value in `metadata.json`
- Missing some cup competitions and leagues e.g. AFCON, Europa Conference League, etc. There is no public ESPN API documentation.
- Some teams are missing from leagues and cup competitions.
- If you make any changes to the schema, recompile the gschema using `glib-compile-schemas schemas`
